# Grap Frontend

This is a simple single page application that mimics a Grab style user flow. It
provides placeholder screens for:

- Restaurant delivery
- Taxi service
- Mart delivery
- Porter service
- Medicine delivery
- Bike taxi service
- User signup and login
- Payment flow (simulated)
- Driver location tracking
- Customer settings for location and currency

Open `index.html` in your browser to explore the different services. Each
section is a minimal mock screen that demonstrates basic navigation between the
home page and the individual services.

Authentication, payment and tracking are simulated in-memory and do not reach
any backend service.

No build step is required as the app pulls React from a CDN. A backend is not
needed for these placeholder screens.
