# Expo Version of grap Frontend

This folder contains a minimal Expo project that mirrors the single page web app. Each service screen is written in React Native so you can run the flow on a mobile device using Expo.

To start the project:

```bash
npm install
npx expo start
```

The backend server from the project root should be running so that API requests for restaurants and driver location succeed.
